## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think the skill of interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program comes with experience. User needs are the tasks and requirements developers work on to produce certain features through code. The way developers understand the user needs is by communicating with the users and receiving their feedback. User stories improve a program by removing the parts that are least useful or profitable. They give the team a critical frame of reference and identify tasks with the value those tasks bring. User stories can be essentially expressed through the following template: As a < type of user >, I want < an action > so that < a value/benefit >.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Program development can be approached in a lot of ways. One of the ways is to implement Waterfall Methodology. Waterfall Methodology entails gathering at the onset of the project, and then creating a sequential project plan to meet those requirements. The waterfall model got its name from the process of phases of the project cascading into the next, following steadily down like a waterfall. Another way of approaching program development is utilizing the Agile methodology. Agile is a way to manage a project by splitting it up into several phases. It entails continuous collaboration with stakeholders and constant improvement at every stage. In my future development work I hope to incorporate agile methodology as it is an organized approach while at the same time being flexible and adaptable. It allows development teams to zero in on value-based development and not be bound by time restrictions which helps to consistently deliver high-value products.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

In software development to be a good team member means to be 
There are countless aspects to being a good team member in software development. One of them is to be an effective communicator. An effective communicator keeps their team members informed throughout the time development process with the least amount of effort. This creates open and safe environment where people feel comfortable sharing
their ideas and thoughts. To be a good team member means to be open to outside ideas and be able to acknowledge different opinions. It also means you care about other people, how they are doing, and what impact you have on them. Finally, personal development is another crucial aspect of being a good team member because without the desire to learn there is no growth.
